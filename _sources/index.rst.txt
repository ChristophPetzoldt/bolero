About
=====

BOLeRo makes behavior learning for robots easy. It combines behavior learning
algorithms with learning problems through defined interfaces that can be used
by a controller. The whole communication between a behavior and an environment
is done by requesting actions generated from the behavior and sensory
information generated by an environment.

Features
========

The highlights of BOLeRo are

* Dynamical Movement Primitives with a final velocity greater than 0 (see
  `Muelling et al.
  <http://www.ausy.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Muelling_IJRR_2013.pdf>`_)
  and correct handling of rotation in Cartesian space (see `Ude et al.
  <http://www-hcr.ijs.si/resources/papers/icra14b.pdf>`_) in C++ with a Python
  wrapper
* Contextual Relative Entropy Policy Search (see `Kupcsik et al.
  <http://www.ausy.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/uploads/Publications/Kupcsik_AAAI_2013.pdf>`_)
* a clean and readable implementation of Covariance Matrix Adaption
  Evolution Strategies (CMA-ES, see
  `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES>`_) and several of its
  variants
* it is easy to combine it with the simulation software
  `MARS <https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars>`_
* C++ interface to Python modules and Python interface to C++ modules
* configuration via YAML

BOLeRo was initiated and is currently developed at the `Robotics Innovation Center
<http://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html>`_
of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Bremen,
together with the `Robotics Group
<http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/robotik/index_en.php>`_ of the University
of Bremen. BOLeRo has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy.
